    "<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>\n",
    "In 2017, new solar PV capacity grew by 50% globally, reaching over 74 GW and surpassing net growth in coal for the first time.  The U.S. remained the second largest growth market for renewables, after China.  It is known that the efficiency of solar panels is heavily dependent on operating temperature.  Commonly installed mono-and polycrystalline solar cells experience an efficiency loss of 0.5% for each degree above 25oC and many solar modules can reach 60 oC in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three team members study engineering and two currently work with renewable energy systems (wind and solar).  Brooke currently works in the Wind Energy & Turbulence Lab in Mechanical Engineering and part of the lab’s research focuses on developing a better understanding of the physical interactions between solar farms and the atmospheric boundary layer, both from a numerical and experimental perspective.  Specifically, the research group aims to develop a model for the convective heat transfer coefficient ‘h’ of solar modules within solar farms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the heat transfer between solar modules and the atmosphere is understood and ‘h’ can be predicted, engineering solutions can be developed and evaluated to manipulate ‘h’ in a way that reduces the operating temperature of solar modules, increasing efficiency and thus, power output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Project Objectives</h2>\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop a model for the convective heat transfer coefficient ‘h’ of solar modules within solar farms from experimental data.  In addition, we aim to address the following questions about the dataset:\n",
    "1.\tIs there a successful model for ‘h’ that depends only on data is typically measured near solar power plants (wind speed, wind direction, ambient temperature, radiation, and relative humidity)? \n",
    "a.\tIf not, which other variables are necessary to predict ‘h’ accurately?\n",
    "2.\tOf the experimental variables, what are the strongest contributors to ‘h’?\n",
    "3.\tWhat other trends and relationships do we see among the atmospheric variables such as wind speed, wind direction, stability, and time?\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Data</h2>\n",
    "The data was collected during the summer of 2017 at a solar PV plant at the Denver Federal Center.  The data collection sensors and methods are shown in the diagram below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![firstdatapic.png](firstdatapic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete list of variables is shown below, consisting of 29 predictor variables and 2 target variables (‘q’ and ‘h’).  The data for these variables was collected at either 1-minute or 20-Hz intervals by sensors on the weather tower shown above including sonic anemometers, cup anemometers, wind vanes, CNR1 net radiometers, Apogee net radiometers, HMP temperature and humidity probes, and Finewire thermocouples.\n",
    "\n",
    "![variabletable.png](variabletable.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variables, ‘q’ and ‘h’, were calculated based on the energy balance model shown below and the plot on the left shows the results for ‘h’.  To validate the model that we develop, the experimental data can be prepared as inputs for the ‘TOMCAT’ model developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to be evaluated externally and returned to us as ‘q’.  With the relationship between ‘q’ and ‘h’ below, results for ‘h’ can be compared.\n",

    "\n",
    "<h2>Data Processing</h2>\n",
    "Much of the data for these variables is currently stored in a .csv file for the entire experiment duration, however, the sonic anemometer data is scattered among numerous .dat files, one for each day consisting of ~1.7 million lines each.  Extensive cleaning, reshaping, and homogenizing of the data will be required.  From the experimental data, 3 “turbulence” variables can be calculated, which may be important contributors to the model for ‘h’.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Pandas module will be used to import and clean the data, specifically with the read_csv function. Modules such as numpy and sklearn may be used in reshaping and homogenizing the data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>\n",
    "For exploratory analysis, the processed and cleaned data will be used to determine the correlations\n",
    "between the predictor variables and the target variables. This will give us a good idea of which variables\n",
    "appear to be significantly impacting the value of h and which can be ignored. We will also use these\n",
    "predictor variables in a well-studied physical model of a plate in wind, an image of which is shown\n",
    "below:\n",
    "![image.png](image.png)\n",
    "(from the Fundamentals of Heat Transfer textbook, Lavine pg. 437)<br>\n",
    "There are several equations and empirical correlations that have been developed for this simplified\n",
    "model. We will use these with our experimental data to determine the accuracy of this model, and if it\n",
    "can reliably predict the heat transfer coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Analysis Methodology</h2>\n",
    "The full analysis will depend on whether the scarecrow model for a flat plate in parallel flow is sufficient\n",
    "for our data. If it is not (the likely scenario), then we will use the data we have to work backwards and\n",
    "come up with the best empirical correlation that accounts for the variance of predictor variables that\n",
    "the simplified model does not include. We will test this new model and see the improvement in accuracy\n",
    "in determining h based on the conditions, which can then potentially be used to predict and minimize\n",
    "unnecessary heat losses in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the simplified model does obtain a reasonably good degree of predictive accuracy, then our data\n",
    "analysis will instead focus on classification. Because the treatment of the plate under laminar and\n",
    "turbulent flow is different, we would aim to create a SVM that distinguishes the two types of flow based\n",
    "on predictor variables. We will also classify the stability of the atmosphere, which is typically assumed as\n",
    "unstable during the day and stable during the night, but a classifier based on these conditions could be\n",
    "very beneficial for other analyses.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<h2>Project Schedule</h2>\n",
    "Week 1: Complete project proposal. Allow team members time to focus on HW8 and midterms before the break.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Week 2: Spring Break, if feeling particularly motivated begin data cleaning.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Week 3: Work towards first project milestone: Two group members can acquire and clean the dataset and one can explore the data and report back to the others on what possible relationships and/or structures of interest may be present in the data.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Week 4: Use comments on first project milestone to make any necessary improvements. Delve into any leads discovered in the data exploration and begin to build our model. Each team member will have a couple possible relationships to explore and can report back and compare results.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Week 5: Finish building our model and compare it to existing research. Two team members can complete the model while the other prepares existing models and data for validation and to finding unique variances associated with the site where we collected the data. Meet and compare these when completed.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Week 6: Complete validation and analysis of our results. Prepare screencast and presentation."
